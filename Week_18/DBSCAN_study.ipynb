    "### How DBSCAN Works\n",
    "\n",
    "DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is a density-based clustering algorithm used to group data points into clusters based on their proximity and density. It identifies clusters as regions of high point density separated by regions of low density.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Concepts:\n",
    "1. **Epsilon (ε)**: Maximum distance between two points to be considered as neighbors.\n",
    "2. **MinPts**: Minimum number of points required to form a dense region (i.e., a cluster).\n",
    "3. **Core Point**: A point with at least `MinPts` neighbors within distance `ε`.\n",
    "4. **Border Point**: A point that is not a core point but is within `ε` distance of a core point.\n",
    "5. **Noise Point (Outlier)**: A point that is neither a core point nor a border point.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps:\n",
    "1. Start with an unvisited point.\n",
    "2. Check if it has at least `MinPts` neighbors within `ε`. If yes:\n",
    "   - Mark it as a **core point**.\n",
    "   - Expand a cluster starting from this core point by adding all density-reachable points (points within `ε` distance of core points).\n",
    "3. If a point is not a core point but is within `ε` of an existing cluster, mark it as a **border point** and add it to the cluster.\n",
    "4. Points that cannot be assigned to any cluster are marked as **noise points**.\n",
    "5. Repeat the process for all points in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages of DBSCAN:\n",
    "1. **Detects Arbitrary Shapes**: Can form clusters of any shape (e.g., spherical, elongated, etc.) unlike K-Means, which assumes spherical clusters.\n",
    "2. **Handles Noise**: Identifies and separates outliers as noise.\n",
    "3. **No Need to Predefine Clusters**: The number of clusters is determined automatically based on the density of the data.\n",
    "4. **Scales Well**: Efficient for large datasets with spatial indexing (e.g., KD-trees).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantages of DBSCAN:\n",
    "1. **Sensitive to Parameters**: \n",
    "   - Choosing the right values for `ε` and `MinPts` can be difficult.\n",
    "   - Poor choices may result in incorrect clustering or excessive noise.\n",
    "2. **Poor Performance with Varying Densities**: Struggles when clusters have significantly different densities, as it uses a single `ε` value globally.\n",
    "3. **High Dimensionality**: Performance degrades in high-dimensional spaces due to the curse of dimensionality.\n",
    "4. **Memory Intensive**: Requires storing all data points in memory, which can be limiting for very large datasets.\n",

    "1. **Epsilon Neighborhood**:\n",
    "   $$N_\\epsilon(p) = \\{q \\in D \\mid \\text{dist}(p, q) \\leq \\epsilon\\}$$\n",
    "   - **Explanation**:\n",
    "     - $N_\\epsilon(p)$: The set of points within a distance $\\epsilon$ from point $p$.\n",

    "     - $\\epsilon$: The radius defining the neighborhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Core Point Condition**:\n",
    "   $$|N_\\epsilon(p)| \\geq \\text{MinPts}$$\n",
    "   - **Explanation**:\n",
    "     - A point $p$ is a **core point** if it has at least $\\text{MinPts}$ points (including itself) in its $\\epsilon$-neighborhood.\n",
    "     - $\\text{MinPts}$: Minimum number of points required to form a dense region.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Density Reachability**:\n",
    "   - A point $q$ is **directly density-reachable** from a core point $p$ if:\n",
    "     $$q \\in N_\\epsilon(p)$$\n",

    "\n",
    "### Steps in DBSCAN:\n",
    "1. For each unvisited point $p$, check its $\\epsilon$-neighborhood:\n",

    "   - If $p$ is not a core point and not density-reachable from any other point, mark it as **noise**.\n",
