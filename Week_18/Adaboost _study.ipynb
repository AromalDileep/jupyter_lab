    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Initialize Sample Weights**\n",
    "- Start with assigning equal weights to all samples in the dataset.\n",
    "  - If there are $ N $ samples, each sample gets a weight of $ \\frac{1}{N} $.\n",
    "  - These weights represent how \"important\" each sample is during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Train the First Weak Learner**\n",
    "- Train a simple model (like a decision stump) on the dataset.\n",
    "- The model tries to classify the samples.\n",
    "- Calculate the **error rate** ($ e_t $) of the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $ e_t = \\frac{\\text{Total weight of misclassified samples}}{\\text{Total weight of all samples}} $\n",
    "\n",
    "  - This gives more weight to samples that were harder to classify.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Calculate the Model's \"Say\" ($ \\alpha_t $)**\n",
    "(Perfomance of the stump)\n",
    "- The better the model, the more \"say\" it gets in making predictions.\n",
    "- Compute:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $ \\alpha_t = \\frac{1}{2} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1 - e_t}{e_t}\\right) $\n",
    "\n",
    "  - $ \\alpha_t > 0 $: Good performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - $ \\alpha_t < 0 $: Poor performance (this rarely happens, as weak learners are expected to perform slightly better than random guessing).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Update Weights of the Samples**\n",
    "- Update the weights to focus more on misclassified samples.\n",
    "- For **correctly classified samples**, reduce their weight:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $ w_{i}^{(t+1)} = w_{i}^{(t)} \\cdot e^{-\\alpha_t} $\n",

    "### **5. Repeat for Multiple Weak Learners**\n",
    "- Train another weak learner on the updated weights.\n",
    "- Repeat steps 2â€“4 for $ T $ iterations, where $ T $ is the number of weak learners.\n",
    "- Each weak learner focuses more on the samples that the previous learners struggled with.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. Combine the Weak Learners**\n",
    "- At the end, combine all the weak learners into a single strong model.\n",
    "- The prediction of the strong model is a weighted sum of the predictions of the weak learners:\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Ideas**\n",
    "- **Focus on Hard Cases**: AdaBoost shifts focus to samples that are hard to classify.\n",
    "- **Combine Weak Learners**: Weak learners (e.g., decision stumps) are combined to form a strong, accurate classifier.\n",
    "- **Weighted Votes**: Learners that perform better get more influence on the final prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example (Intuition)**\n",
    "Imagine you're teaching a group of students for a test:\n",
    "1. In the first session, you focus equally on all students, but some students fail to understand.\n",
    "2. In the second session, you spend more time helping the struggling students.\n",
    "3. In the third session, you again adjust your focus based on who still needs help.\n",
    "4. At the end, you combine all your efforts, and everyone is better prepared.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, AdaBoost keeps adjusting its focus on the \"hard-to-learn\" samples and builds a strong classifier by combining weak ones.\n",
