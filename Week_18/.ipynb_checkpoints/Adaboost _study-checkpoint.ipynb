Initialize Sample Weights**\n","- Start with assigning equal weights to all samples in the dataset.\n","  - If there are $ N $ samples, each sample gets a weight of $ \\frac{1}{N} $.\n","  - These weights represent how \"important\" each sample is during training.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **2. Train the First Weak Learner**\n","- Train a simple model (like a decision stump) on the dataset.\n","- The model tries to classify the samples.\n","- Calculate the **error rate** ($ e_t $) of the model:\n","\n","  $ e_t = \\frac{\\text{Total weight of misclassified samples}}{\\text{Total weight of all samples}} $\n","\n","  - This gives more weight to samples that were harder to classify.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **3.

Update Weights of the Samples**\n","- Update the weights to focus more on misclassified samples.\n","- For **correctly classified samples**, reduce their weight:\n","\n","  $ w_{i}^{(t+1)} = w_{i}^{(t)} \\cdot e^{-\\alpha_t} $\n","\n","- For **misclassified samples**, increase their weight:\n","\n","  $ w_{i}^{(t+1)} = w_{i}^{(t)} \\cdot e^{\\alpha_t} $\n","\n","- Normalize the weights so they sum to 1:\n","\n","  $ w_{i}^{(t+1)} = \\frac{w_{i}^{(t+1)}}{\\sum_{j=1}^N w_{j}^{(t+1)}} $\n","\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **5.
