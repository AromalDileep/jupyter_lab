    "### **Ward's Linkage in Agglomerative Clustering (Step-by-Step)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ward's Linkage is a method to calculate the distance between clusters. It focuses on minimizing the increase in **within-cluster variance** (or Sum of Squared Errors, SSE) when clusters are merged. Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step-by-Step Process**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start with each data point as its own cluster**:\n",
    "   - Initially, every data point is treated as an individual cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Compute the centroids of clusters**:\n",
    "   - A **centroid** is the mean of all points in a cluster.\n",
    "   - For a cluster $A$, its centroid $\\bar{x}_A$ is calculated as:\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     \\bar{x}_A = \\frac{1}{|A|} \\sum_{x \\in A} x\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     - $|A|$: Number of points in cluster $A$.\n",
    "     - $x$: Data points in cluster $A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Calculate the increase in variance (SSE) if two clusters are merged**:\n",
    "   - For two clusters $A$ and $B$, the increase in SSE is given by:\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     d(A, B) = \\sqrt{\\frac{|A| \\cdot |B|}{|A| + |B|}} \\cdot \\|\\bar{x}_A - \\bar{x}_B\\|^2\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     - $\\bar{x}_A$ and $\\bar{x}_B$: Centroids of clusters $A$ and $B$.\n",
    "     - $|A|$ and $|B|$: Number of points in clusters $A$ and $B$.\n",
    "   - This measures how much the \"compactness\" of clusters decreases when they are merged.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Find the pair of clusters with the smallest increase in variance**:\n",
    "   - Among all possible pairs of clusters, select the pair $(A, B)$ with the smallest $d(A, B)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Merge the selected clusters**:\n",
    "   - Combine the two clusters $A$ and $B$ into a single cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Repeat steps 2-5**:\n",
    "   - Recompute the centroids and distances for the updated clusters.\n",
    "   - Continue merging clusters until all points belong to a single cluster or until the desired number of clusters is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Why Ward's Linkage?**\n",
    "- Ward’s method minimizes the increase in the **within-cluster variance** after merging clusters. This results in compact and spherical clusters, making it a good choice for datasets with such characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example (Intuitive Walkthrough)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Suppose we have 4 points: $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$.\n",
    "- Each starts as its own cluster.\n",
    "- Step-by-step:\n",
    "  1. Compute centroids of all clusters.\n",
    "  2. Calculate the SSE increase for merging every pair (e.g., $d(A, B)$, $d(A, C)$, etc.).\n",
    "  3. Merge the pair with the smallest increase in SSE.\n",
    "  4. Update centroids and repeat.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Dendrogram**:\n",
    "- The results of Ward's Linkage are often visualized with a **dendrogram**.\n",
    "- The height of each merge in the dendrogram represents the increase in SSE at that step.\n",
    "- You can \"cut\" the dendrogram at a specific height to decide the number of clusters."
